    "Waste is a significant global issue. Increasing volumes of waste are being generated as the global population and living standards rise. People are increasingly concerned about the production of waste and its effect, and are seeking ways to deal with the problem.\n",
    "Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from incineration), and water pollution (from landfilling).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can contibute in the solution of this issue using machine learning. Some suggested approaches include:\n",
    "- Studying white papers on waste management.\n",
    "- Analysing te components of household waste.\n",
    "- Separating organic and recycable wastes into classes.\n",
    "- Automating the process using IoT and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such approaches may help in making the recycling process easier."
